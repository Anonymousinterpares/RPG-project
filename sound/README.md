# Sound Directory

The `sound` directory contains audio assets used in the game.

## Directory Structure

The sound files are organized into categories:

- `effects/` - Sound effects for game events and actions
- `music/` - Background music tracks
- `ambient/` - Ambient sound loops
- `dialogue/` - Voice clips for dialogue (if applicable)

## Sound Format

The game supports the following audio formats:
- MP3 (.mp3) - For music and longer audio
- WAV (.wav) - For short sound effects
- OGG (.ogg) - Alternative compressed format

## Implementation Status

The sound system is planned but not yet fully implemented. The current status includes:

- Basic directory structure in place
- Plans for a `MusicManager` class (to be implemented)
- Integration with the GUI planned
- Browser-based audio playback for the web UI planned

## Planned Features

1. Dynamic background music based on location and events
2. Ambient sound effects for different environments
3. Sound effects for actions (combat, inventory, etc.)
4. Volume control and mute options
5. Cross-fade between tracks
6. Playlist management

## Usage (When Implemented)

Sound will be managed through the `MusicManager` class:

```python
from sound.music_manager import MusicManager

# Play background music
music_manager = MusicManager()
music_manager.play_track("town_theme")

# Play a sound effect
music_manager.play_effect("sword_slash")
```

## Web Implementation (Planned)

For the web UI, audio will be handled through:
- API endpoints to control music playback
- Browser-based audio playback using Web Audio API
