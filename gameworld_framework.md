# SHATTERED RESONANCE
## Fantasy World Building Guide

## CORE CONCEPT
This world, called Aetheris, was once a single unified reality until "The Shattering" - a catastrophic magical event that fractured the world into overlapping planes of reality. These planes occasionally merge, causing "Resonance Events" where landscapes, creatures, and cultures temporarily blend before separating again. This has led to unique evolutionary paths, cultural adaptations, and magical systems.

## WORLD HISTORY

### The Age of Harmony (Ancient Era)
- Aetheris was once a singular reality where all races existed in harmony under the watchful eye of the Luminaries - cosmic entities who maintained balance.
- Magic was a natural force, accessible through song and ritualistic movements rather than formal spellcasting.
- Society was nomadic, following seasonal magical currents across the land.

### The Shattering (Defining Cataclysm)
- Approximately 2,500 years ago, an experiment by the Cipher Conclave, an ancient mage collective seeking immortality, tore reality apart.
- The world split into five overlapping planes: Verdant (nature), Crystalline (order), Ashen (decay), Tempest (chaos), and Nexus (the central plane where most inhabitants now dwell).
- The Luminaries were scattered across the planes, their essences fragmented.

### The Age of Isolation (1-1000 AS - After Shattering)
- Surviving populations adapted to their new isolated realities.
- First Resonance Events occurred, terrifying and disorienting as planes temporarily merged.
- The Five Speakers emerged - individuals who could hear the "voices" of the fragmented Luminaries.

### The Age of Discovery (1000-2000 AS)
- Civilizations developed ways to predict and utilize Resonance Events.
- The Harmonic Order formed to study and catalog plane interactions.
- First intentional cross-plane settlements established.

### The Modern Age (2000-2500 AS)
- Sophisticated societies have emerged that incorporate elements from multiple planes.
- Resonance Events are now celebrated cultural occurrences, though unpredictable ones can still be dangerous.
- Rumors of methods to permanently reunite the planes circulate, causing political and ideological tension.

## CULTURES & SOCIETIES

### The Concordant Cities
- **Capital**: Harmonia
- **Culture**: These seven interconnected city-states sit at major Resonance nodes on Nexus plane. Their architecture constantly shifts as it incorporates elements from other planes during Resonance Events.

- **Structure**: Loosely organized collectives led by "Disruptors" - individuals who can temporarily intensify plane separation.
- **Current Agenda**: Sabotaging reunification efforts; inducing controlled Resonance Events to strengthen the barriers between planes.

### The Mercantile Chord
- **Base**: Trading hubs at the edges of major settlements across all planes
- **Purpose**: Profit from cross-plane commerce and the unique resources each plane provides.
- **Structure**: Guild-based organization with specialized traders for each plane's goods.
- **Current Agenda**: Monopolizing "Resonant Materials" - items that retain properties from multiple planes.

### The Five Speakers
- **Base**: Individual territories throughout Nexus
- **Purpose**: Each communicates with a fragmented Luminary, interpreting their will.
- **Structure**: Quasi-religious leaders with devoted followers.
- **Current Agenda**: The Speakers disagree on whether the Luminaries want reunification, leading to growing conflict between their factions.

## CONFLICTS & TENSIONS

### The Resonance Crisis
- Resonance Events are becoming more frequent and unpredictable.
- Some believe this heralds an imminent collapse of the planar boundaries.
- Others see it as an opportunity for permanent reunification.
