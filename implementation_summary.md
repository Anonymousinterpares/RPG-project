# Skill Check System Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### Skill Check System
- ✅ Created GUI component (`SkillCheckDisplay`) for displaying skill check results with animation
- ✅ Updated the `GameOutputWidget` to integrate the skill check display
- ✅ Added support in `RuleCheckerAgent` for performing skill checks
- ✅ Updated the `NarratorAgent` to recognize skill check commands
- ✅ Implemented processing of skill check commands in `AgentManager`
- ✅ Created command formats for skill checks: 
  - `{STAT_CHECK:<stat>:<difficulty>:<context>}`
  - `{RULE_CHECK:<action>:<stat>:<difficulty>:<context>}`

### LLM Integration for Stats
- ✅ Updated system prompt templates to include stat-related commands
- ✅ Added command processing for skill checks and stat modifications
- ✅ Updated the checklist to reflect completed tasks

## Next Steps

### Stat Allocation System (Item 14)
- [ ] Create GUI for stat allocation during character creation (14.2)
- [ ] Create GUI for handling stat points during level-up (14.3)
- [ ] Implement validation and feedback for stat allocation (14.4)
- [ ] Add class/race-specific stat minimums and bonuses (14.5)
- [ ] Add presets for different character archetypes (14.6)

### Combat System UI (Item 15)
- [ ] Update GUI to display combat information (15.8)
- [ ] Integrate the skill check system with combat rolls (15.9)

### LLM Integration for Stats (Remaining Items in 19)
- [ ] Update `ContextEvaluatorAgent` to track relevant stat changes (19.3)
- [ ] Implement the `{CONTEXT_EVAL:situation:relevant_stats:importance}` command (19.4)

### Memory and Context Integration
- [ ] Integrate stats with the memory system (21.4)
- [ ] Track important combat encounters and outcomes (21.5)
- [ ] Store narrative-significant stat changes (21.6)

## Testing Required
- Test skill check commands from the narrator agent
- Verify that the skill check display appears correctly in the UI
- Test different stat types and difficulty levels
- Test critical success/failure display and animations

## Notes
- The skill check system is now fully implemented and integrated with both the UI and LLM system
- The next logical step would be to implement the stat allocation UI components for character creation and level-up
- The combat system UI should be prioritized after that to make full use of the skill check system
