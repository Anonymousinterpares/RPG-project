# Web UI Game Loading Fixes - Applied 2025-09-30

## Summary
Fixed critical bugs preventing proper game loading functionality in the web UI, including 404 errors, undefined variable errors, and incomplete UI updates.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ API Client - Corrected Endpoint Usage
**Files Modified:** `web/client/js/api-client.js`

**Problem:** 
- The `loadGame()` and `endSession()` methods had comments added but were already using correct endpoint structure
- The actual issue was in how the frontend flow managed sessions

**Changes:**
- Added clarifying comments to `loadGame()` method (line 294)
- Added clarifying comments to `endSession()` method (line 344)
- These methods were already correctly structured with session_id in URL path

### 2. ✅ UI Manager - Fixed Undefined Variable Error
**File Modified:** `web/client/js/ui-manager.js`

**Problem:**
- Line 2397 had duplicate assignment: `this._prevMode = mode;`
- Variable `mode` was not defined, causing: `ReferenceError: mode is not defined`
- This crashed `refreshUI()` before it could populate the right panel with character stats

**Changes:**
- **REMOVED** line 2397: `this._prevMode = mode;`
- Added clarifying comment: "Update previous mode for next comparison"
- Now only line 2396 sets `this._prevMode` correctly: `this._prevMode = inCombat ? 'COMBAT' : modeStr;`

**Before:**
```javascript
this._prevMode = inCombat ? 'COMBAT' : modeStr;
this._prevMode = mode;  // ❌ ERROR: mode is not defined
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Update previous mode for next comparison
this._prevMode = inCombat ? 'COMBAT' : modeStr;
```

### 3. ✅ Main.js - Improved Load Game Flow
**File Modified:** `web/client/js/main.js`

**Problem:**
- Complex retry logic with nested try-catch blocks
- First attempt always failed with 404 because session management was unclear
- Error handling created a new session and retried, making the flow confusing
- Modal wasn't closed on success
- `refreshUI()` wasn't explicitly called after loading

**Changes:**
- Simplified load game flow to be linear and predictable
- Always clean up existing session first (if any)
- Create fresh session before loading
- Connect WebSocket before loading to receive events
- Add 200ms delay to ensure WebSocket is ready
- Call `refreshUI()` explicitly after successful load to populate right panel
- Close modal after successful load
- Removed complex retry logic (no longer needed with proper session management)

**Before:**
```javascript
async function loadGame(saveId) {
    if (!apiClient.hasActiveSession()) {
        // create session
    }
    
    const attemptLoad = async () => { ... };
    
    try {
        const result = await attemptLoad();
        // handle success
    } catch (error) {
        // retry with new session
        try {
            await apiClient.endSession();
            const resultNew = await apiClient.createSession();
            // retry attemptLoad()
        } catch (err2) {
            // handle final error
        }
    }
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
async function loadGame(saveId) {
    try {
        // Clean up existing session
        if (apiClient.hasActiveSession()) {
            await apiClient.endSession();
            webSocketClient.disconnect();
        }
        
        // Create fresh session
        const sessionResult = await apiClient.createSession();
        
        // Connect WebSocket
        connectWebSocket(sessionResult.session_id);
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200));
        
        // Load game
        const result = await apiClient.loadGame(saveId);
        
        if (result.status === 'success') {
            updateGameState(result.state);
            uiManager.enableCommandInput();
            await uiManager.refreshUI();  // ← NEW: Explicitly refresh UI
            uiManager.closeAllModals();   // ← NEW: Close modal
            uiManager.showNotification('Game loaded successfully', 'success');
        }
    } catch (error) {
        // Single error handler
    }
}
```

## Expected Results

After these fixes, loading a saved game should:

1. ✅ **No more 404 errors** - Session is created before loading
2. ✅ **No more undefined variable errors** - `mode` error eliminated
3. ✅ **Right panel populates correctly** - `refreshUI()` completes successfully
4. ✅ **Clean flow** - No failed attempts followed by retries
5. ✅ **Modal closes** - Load game dialog closes on success
6. ✅ **Console logs are clean** - Only success messages

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Load a saved game from the web UI
- [ ] Verify no 404 errors in browser console
- [ ] Verify no JavaScript errors in browser console
- [ ] Verify right panel shows character stats (name, race, class, level, resources)
- [ ] Verify status bar shows correct location and time
- [ ] Verify reintroductory narrative appears in output area
- [ ] Verify load game modal closes after successful load
- [ ] Verify command input is enabled
- [ ] Verify can send commands after loading

## Files Changed

1. `web/client/js/api-client.js` - Added clarifying comments
2. `web/client/js/ui-manager.js` - Removed duplicate broken assignment (line 2397)
3. `web/client/js/main.js` - Completely refactored `loadGame()` function (lines 538-596)

## Technical Notes

- The core issue was **session management timing** - the session needed to exist before calling `loadGame()`
- The `mode` undefined error was a **typo/copy-paste error** where a line was duplicated with wrong variable name
- The API endpoints were already correct; the flow logic was the problem
- WebSocket connection timing is important - need to wait briefly after connecting before loading

## Rollback Information

If these changes need to be reverted, restore from git commit before this change or use the backup files if created.
