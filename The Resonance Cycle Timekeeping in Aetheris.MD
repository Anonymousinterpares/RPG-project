# The Resonance Cycle: Timekeeping in Aetheris

In the fractured world of Aetheris, the traditional celestial markers of sun and moon are deemed unreliable guides for the passage of time. Instead, the civilizations that rose from The Shattering measure their lives by the one constant force that shapes their existence: the cyclical ebb and flow of planar influence. This elegant and complex system, developed over centuries of meticulous observation by the Harmonic Order, is known as the Resonance Calendar, or more commonly, the Grand Cycle. It is a calendar not of stars, but of realities.

## The Grand Cycle

An Aetherian "year" is known as a Grand Cycle. It marks a complete rotation through the dominant influences of the four outer planes upon the central world of Nexus. This cycle is divided into four major seasons, called **Phases**, each with a distinct character that permeates the culture, environment, and even the mood of the people.

### The Phases of a Grand Cycle

*   **The Verdant Bloom:** This is a phase of explosive growth and vitality, when the influence of the Verdant plane is strongest. The air feels charged with life, flora grows with astonishing speed, and the natural world becomes more vibrant and active. For the people of Aetheris, it is a time of renewal, new beginnings, and celebration of life's persistence. Cultures with strong ties to nature, like the Verdant Collective, hold this phase as their most sacred.

*   **The Crystalline Stillness:** As the Verdant influence wanes, the orderly and predictable energies of the Crystalline plane take hold. This phase is marked by calm, stable weather and a palpable sense of clarity in the air. The boundaries between planes are at their most resilient, making it the safest time for travel and construction. It is a season for logic, study, and precision. The Crystalline Consortium considers this period its zenith, a time when their mathematical and magical workings are most effective.

*   **The Ashen Veil:** This is a phase of introspection, memory, and graceful decay. The world's colors seem to mute, the air grows still and cool, and a sense of history permeates the very soil. It is believed that during the Veil, the barrier to the Ashen plane thins, allowing for a deeper connection to ancestral spirits and the echoes of the past. The Ashen Covenant observes this as a time of great spiritual significance, dedicated to remembrance and honoring the cycle of impermanence.

*   **The Tempest's Fury:** The final phase of the cycle is a chaotic and unpredictable time when the Tempest plane's influence holds sway. The weather becomes volatile, storms are frequent, and the very fabric of reality feels frayed and charged with energy. It is a dangerous but exhilarating period, seen by many as a time of great opportunity and sudden change. The Tempest Flotilla thrives in this chaos, viewing it as the ultimate expression of freedom and the boundless potential of the universe.

## The Tides

Each Phase of the Grand Cycle is composed of two **Tides**, which function as the "months" of the Aetherian calendar. To honor the central role of the Nexus plane in maintaining balance, two special Tides mark the beginning and end of the cycle, creating a ten-Tide year.

1.  **Tide of Awakening (Nexus):** The start of the new Grand Cycle. A balanced time for planning and setting intentions for the year ahead.
2.  **Tide of Growth (Verdant):** The first bloom of the Verdant Phase, a time of planting and nurturing new life.
3.  **Tide of Life (Verdant):** The height of the Verdant influence, marked by celebrations of fertility and nature.
4.  **Tide of Order (Crystalline):** The beginning of the Crystalline Stillness, a period for establishing structure and initiating long-term projects.
5.  **Tide of Clarity (Crystalline):** The peak of stability, when minds are considered sharpest and truths are most easily perceived.
6.  **Tide of Fading (Ashen):** The start of the Ashen Veil, a time for harvesting and giving thanks for the year's bounty.
7.  **Tide of Memory (Ashen):** The deepest point of the Veil, dedicated to ancestor veneration and storytelling.
8.  **Tide of Flux (Tempest):** The onset of the Tempest's Fury, a time to prepare for chaos and embrace change.
9.  **Tide of Storms (Tempest):** The height of the Tempest's influence, a period of both great danger and immense energy.
10. **Tide of Harmonization (Nexus):** The end of the cycle. A time for reflection, reconciliation, and finding balance before the next Awakening.

## The Span

The Aetherian "week" is a five-day period called a **Span**. Each day is named for one of the five planes, reflecting the belief that each plane exerts a subtle, daily influence on the world.

*   **Verdas:** A day associated with nature, growth, and healing. It is considered auspicious for planting, foraging, and beginning new personal ventures.
*   **Crysdas:** A day for logic, learning, and craftsmanship. It is favored for study, trade negotiations, and tasks requiring precision.
*   **Ashdas:** A day of reflection and remembrance. It is a time for honoring the past, finishing old tasks, and quiet contemplation.
*   **Tempas:** An unpredictable day of change and opportunity. It is seen as a day to take risks, embark on adventures, or break from routine. Superstition holds that plans made on Tempas rarely go as expected.
*   **Nexdas:** The central day of the span, associated with community, diplomacy, and social bonds. It is the most common day for markets, gatherings, and civic activities.

## Major Festivals & Cultural Events

The Resonance Calendar is punctuated by significant cultural events that are deeply woven into the fabric of Aetherian society.

*   **The Resonance Festivals (Concordant Culture):** Held several times a year during predicted major Resonance Events, these festivals are the cornerstone of Concordant identity. Rather than fearing the merging of planes, the Concordant Cities celebrate it as a source of their strength, diversity, and adaptability. The largest of these, the **Grand Convergence Gala**, takes place during the Tide of Harmonization and is a week-long celebration of art, music, and diplomacy from all corners of their known reality.

*   **The Season Shifting (Verdant Collective):** A solemn and foundational ritual that occurs on the first day of each of the four main Phases. During this ceremony, members of the Verdant Collective formally transition to new societal roles based on the needs of the coming season. This practice embodies their core values of symbiosis and renewal, ensuring that every individual understands all aspects of their society and preventing the stagnation of rigid hierarchies.

*   **The Calculation Contest (Crystalline Consortium):** An annual intellectual competition of immense prestige held during the Tide of Clarity. Individuals and teams engage in complex mathematical and magical problem-solving. The results are not merely for honor; they directly influence social standing, research funding, and the allocation of rare resources for the coming cycle, reflecting the Consortium's deeply meritocratic and logic-driven culture.

*   **The Possession Exchange (Ashen Covenant):** A profound monthly ritual where all material goods—from tools to tents to personal trinkets—are collected and redistributed among the community. This ceremony is the ultimate expression of the Covenant's philosophy of impermanence. It is a powerful, humbling reminder that nothing is truly owned and that attachment to material things is a barrier to spiritual freedom.

*   **The Tempest Harbor Arrival (Tempest Flotilla):** This is not a fixed event but a rare and celebrated celestial alignment that allows the Tempest Flotilla to anchor at the Nexus plane. The arrival of their chaotic, vibrant harbor is a period of intense, opportunistic trade and cultural collision. It embodies the Flotilla's values of freedom, seizing opportunity, and constant motion.

*   **The Veiled Equinox (Cross-Cultural Lore):** A piece of folklore shared among planar travelers and mystics. It speaks of a brief, whispered moment that occurs only twice per Grand Cycle—at the exact midpoint between the Verdant and Ashen Phases. During this perfect equilibrium of creation and decay, the mysterious **Ghost Market** is said to materialize, offering impossible goods to those brave enough to find it and wise enough to pay its price.
