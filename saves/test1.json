Merchants hawk their wares from colorful stalls, children chase each other through the crowd, and the rhythmic clang of a blacksmith's hammer echoes from a nearby forge. The imposing walls of the town hall loom over the square, a symbol of the local authority. A weathered notice board stands at the edge of the square, covered in various announcements and requests.\n\nYou have arrived in Oakhaven after a long journey, seeking... well, that is the question, isn't it? Your family, though respected, has fallen on hard times, and you've been sent to seek your fortune, or at least, a means of restoring your family's dwindling resources. The town offers a fresh start, a place to forge your own destiny, and perhaps, to uncover the secrets that led to your family's current predicament. What will you do first, Qaa?\n",
