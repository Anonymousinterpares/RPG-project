Stalls overflowing with exotic wares from a thousand planes jostle for space, their vibrant colours assaulting your eyes. The air hums with a chaotic symphony of barters, boasts, and the strange, ethereal music of planar energies intermingling. You grip the focus crystal at your neck, its cool smoothness a grounding presence amidst the sensory overload. Around you, beings of every imaginable form throng the narrow walkways, their voices rising and falling in a babel of languages. A whiff of spiced xindfruit from Xylos mingles with the metallic tang of forge-fire from Mechanus, creating an olfactory tapestry both fascinating and overwhelming. You stand at the threshold, a lone elf amidst a sea of the unfamiliar, the weight of your mission pressing heavily upon you. To the north, the market appears to ascend towards the higher rings, while to the south, you can make out what looks like a more residential district. East and west are more of the sprawling market. You feel a slight twinge in your legs, and consider the next step.",

You recall your arrival, the sensory overload nearly overwhelming your senses. The northern path seems to lead upwards towards the higher rings of the market, while the southern path descends into what appears to be a more residential area.

To your left, a hulking goliath, easily towering over the crowd, examines a rack of weapons with a discerning eye. To your right, a pair of gnomish merchants haggle loudly over the price of some shimmering dust, their voices high-pitched and grating.

The market around you seems to fade into a blur as adrenaline surges through your veins. The gnome, startled by your sudden attack, lets out a yelp of surprise, dropping the pouch he was clutching as he stumbles backwards, narrowly avoiding the worst of your blow. The crowd around you gasps, a ripple of shock spreading through the marketplace as the chaotic scene erupts. The other gnome, his eyes wide with disbelief and fear, scrambles away, knocking over several vials in his panic.
