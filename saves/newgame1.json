Though the cobblestones beneath your feet are solid, you remember the elder's words: 'All returns to ash.' The simple robes of your newly initiated cleric sway gently, a constant reminder of impermanence as faint trails of ash drift from your form. \n\nThe square itself is a vibrant tapestry of activity. Townsfolk haggle over wares at stalls overflowing with produce, while children chase pigeons across the open space. A weathered stone fountain gurgles merrily in the center, its water catching the sunlight. To the north, a sturdy-looking town hall stands sentinel, its doors slightly ajar. Eastward, a narrow alleyway beckons with shadowed mystery, while to the west, a well-worn path leads towards what appears to be the town's market district. Before you, a notice board is plastered with various announcements and requests. You feel a sense of anticipation, a quiet excitement to see where your path with the Ashen Covenant will lead you in this new place.",
